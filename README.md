# wpa_supplicant_automator
A simple python script to automate wifi connection using wpa_supplicant using subprocess module on Linux.

In next versions, I'll refactor the code to make it more scalabe and refined.

##Instructions:

1. make it executable with 'chmod +x'
2. edit the script using a text editor
  2.1. edit the interface name for your wifi card (ex: wlan0)
  2.2. modify the SSID and Phassword for 'wpa_passphrase' 
3. save and exit the editor
4. run the script
Optional:
5. it's recommended to add the executable script to '/usr/bin' or just add its address to the environment.
